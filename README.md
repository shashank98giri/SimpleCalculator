# SimpleCalculator
Simple calculator interface for PCs.
This is my first project using **_Swing Gui_** on Github.
## Running The Code
- Download Github for Desktop using [Github for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Download Eclipse IDE from the link http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/neon3
- Download Java SDK form [this link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) if you do not have one.
 - Clone the repository and open it with eclipse
 - Run the code and see the Calculator Interface visible.
 - You can perform simple binary operations with integers and decimals and obtain results.
 
P.S The code has only Buttons activated and typing from the keyboard would not help. So you have to click on the individual buttons to do 
calculations.This is a simple yet useful project to do some minor calculations.
